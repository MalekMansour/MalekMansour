**`Game Developer / Software Developer / Web Developer`**

Hello, I'm Malek Mansour, a dedicated Software Developer currently enrolled in the Software Development program at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT) in Calgary, Canada.

I possess a versatile technical skill set, including proficiency in JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, Python, C#, Unity, MySQL, Oracle SQL, and more. My professional journey is highlighted by winning first place at prestigious hackathons such as YYC HACKS and SAIT HACK, where I helped with the development of groundbreaking applications like YYC Scan and TEDI.

YYC Scan is an innovative application designed to enhance user engagement by gamifying the exploration of Calgary, while TEDI is a community app for SAIT students, facilitating connections and providing valuable information through features like chat, discussion boards, and an OpenAI-powered chatbot. These projects utilized cutting-edge technologies such as Flutter, Dart, Firebase, Azure, Python, and various web development tools, demonstrating my ability to integrate complex systems and deliver user-centric solutions.
